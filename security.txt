CloudHSM
is a cloud based hardware security module(HSM) enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys

AWS Shield
Protects against DDos attacks
safeguard web applications
minimize application downtime and latency
standard and advanced

Peneration Testing
practice of testing of one's own app security for vulnerabilities by simulating an attack
limite set of resource where it can be perfomed like EC2 , RDS etc

*** if account is comprimised follow these steps
AWS root account password
IAM users credentials
delete APi access keys
