AWS History

when services were busy for cybermondat etc amazon realised they need to rent their hardware to someone else
165 services  like computing, storage etc
22 geographical regions

Region 
*a geographical area 
* with 2 or more AZ 
* isolated from other AWS regions (currently 22)
Availabilty Zone(AZ) 
* one or more data centers and have direct , low latency, high throughput adn redundant network connections b/w each other
* are physically separate and isolated from other AZ
* locations where you launch resources such as EC2
* Each AZ is designed as an independent failure zone
* AZ are physically separated within typical metrolpolitan region, and use discrete power sources
** fast netwok connections b/w availability zones in a single region

Serivces can be global or local like IAM is a global service
s3 is global service but data will only be stored in a certain region like buckets can only be created in us east region
global: IAM, s3, cloudfront, route 53, direct connect etc

Pricing:
compute(EC2, ECS, RDS, AWS lambda) -> pay for dedicated server how long they are used
storage(s3, glacier, EBS, EFS) -> pay for data stored
inbound -> data coming to s3 free
outbound -> data coming from s3 will be charged like customers pulling data

Ondemand:
used for compute & database
standard payments

dedicated instances
available for EC2
complete hardware for entire customer

spot instances
purchase spare capacity with great discounts
but instances will go away when AWS needs it

reservations
1 to 3 yr term reserve
no upfront, paprtial upfront, all upfront

Acceptable policy read them

IAM
creating user, groups, roles, policies, MFA
identity federation: able to integrate external directory mostly active directory microsoft
user account will be stored in active directory where windows machine is connected and can use same user account in AWS
also login to aws account
API keys for programmatic access

IAM policy ->IAM user -> single user that represents a person or service
IAM policy ->IAM Group -> multiple users are stored in a group such as operations group, developers group, system admins group etc
IAM policy -> IAM role -> suppose a amazon EC2 instance is provisioned and wants to access s3 for storing data
all these 3 have policy attached to them to tell what they can access

IAM users
* assigned to individual or service
* can be assigned
  an access key id(username), secret access key(password) for programmatic access to AWS API, CLI, SDK
  a password for aws management console
* By default users cannot access anything in your account(you need to assign policies or add them to groups which has policies setup)
*** Zero permissions assigned when a user is created in AWS.
* root account has full admimn privileges and cannot be restricted like billing etc
best practice:
  * dont share/use root credentials
  * always create IAM users and assign permissions
  * enable MFA
  * not to also share accounts
*** IAM users are created to represent applications and these are known as Service Accounts  
* you can have 5000 users per AWS account
* each user had friendly name and an Amazon resource name(ARN) which uniquely identifies user
* password policy

IAM groups
groups are collections of users and have policies attached to them
use groups to assign permissions to users
always give least privilege when assigning permissions
cannot nest groups

IAM Roles
* with IAM roles you can delegate permissions to resources for users and services without using permanent credentials(eg username and password)
if your application on EC2 needs to write to a DB or s3 you assign a role instead of having username or password on server
or in code.
* obtain temporary credentials to make API calls which will expire and gets newer ones
* you can delegate using roles
* use roles for applications that run on AWS EC2 instances

IAM policies
* documents that define permissions can be applied to users, groups and roles
ex: full permission to access s3
* written in JSON
* all permissions are denied by default (granting access to s3 wont give access to Dynamo DB)
* most restricive policy is applied
* IAM policy simulator

IAM authentication methods
access key ID combo(access key & secret key id)
when created IAM returns access key id & secret key
secret key is only returned at creation time and if lost new key should be created
ensure access keys and secret keys are stored securely
users can be given access to change thier own keys through IAM policy
can dusable a user;s access key which prevents it from being used for API calls

login from web browser using username & password
allow users to change their own passwords
can allow selected IAM users to change their passwords

MFA
root accounts should alwasy have MFA
also privileged users

Amazon security token service (STS)
web service that enables you to request temprary limited privilege credntials for IAM users 
global service
all regions are enabled by default
credentials work globally

IAM best practices
Rotate credentials regularly
remove unnecessary credentials
use policy conditions for extra security (for ex: IAM policy document has to be from certain ipaddress when accessing aws)
Monitor activuty in AWS account
