Elastic Load Balancing
* ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets such as EC2 instances, containers and Ip 
addresses
* ELB can hanlde load of your application traffic in a single AZ or across multi AZ
* HA, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make applications fault tolerant
* types
   Application Load Balancer -> routes connections based on content of request level
   layer 7(what we use)
   most used with http & https including microservices & containers
   routes traffic within VPC based on content of request
   http and https
   Network Load Balancer -> routes connection based on IP protocol data layer 4
   handles millions of requests at low latency
   tcp traffic
   classic load balancer -> deprecated 

*** Load balancer sits in a VPC.

AutoScaling
Horizontal scaling
elasticity and scalability
adding or removing based on traffic demand for your application
right number of instances available to handle load
collections of instances called Autoscaling Groups (ASG)
can specify min number of instances & max number of instances
will also ensure group has this many nunber of instances like if i specify 3 it means 3 is awlays running(self healing)
can autoscale based on CPU usage

*** Load baalncer does health checks
*** ASG does EC2 instance checks
