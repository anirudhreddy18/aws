shared responsibility model defines what you and AWS are responsible
security & compliance is shared responsibility
AWS responsible for security of cloud
  protecting infrastructure
  hardware, software, networking and facilities that run cloud services
Customers
  EC2 instance (network ACL's, security groups, os system patches & updates, IAM, client & server side encryption)
Inherited Models
  physical and environmental controls
Shared controls
  Patch Management -> AWS responsible for patching any fixing flaws in infrastructure, but customers patch their guest os and
  applications (like linux or windows)
  Config Management -> AWS maintains config of its infrastucture devices, but customer responsible for thier own guest os,
  databases and applications
  Awareness & Training -> AWS trains their own employees, customers need to train their own
Customer Specific - controls which are solely the responsibility of customer based in application they deploy within AWS
  Sercices and Communications Protection or zone security may require customer to route or zone data within specific security
  env's

AWS Compliance
**** Compliance responsibilities are shared
AWS has all these certifications like PCI, ISO etc 
AWS artifact is a place where you can go & download security & compliance reports

AWS Config
Fully managed service that provides AWS resource inventory
discover AWS resources, export a complete inventory and describe how a resource was configured
configuration management
cloudTrail: records user API activity
config records point in time configuration details for AWS resources
what did my resources looks like?
who made an API call to modify resource?

Encryption: KMS and CloudHSM
KMS(Key management service)
gives control over encryption keys to protect your data
create, import, rotate, disable, delete, define and audit use of encryption keys
easy to integrate with AWS Services and encrypt data stored in these services(like encrypt data in RDS Database)
CloudHSM
is a cloud based hardware security module(HSM) enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys

AWS inspector
improve security & compliance
scan applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices
an agent must be installed on Ec2 instances

AWS Trusted advisor
helps reduce cost, increates performance, and imporve security
real tiem guidance to help you provision your resources with best practices
advise on cost optimization, security & fault tolerance

AWS personal health dashboard
alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may affect you
aws will alert you if they are having infrastructure problems

AWS WAF
Web application firewall
protect agianst common exploits application avaialability, security or consume excessive resouces
mainly CSRF, Sql injection etc (malicious attacks)

AWS Shield
Protects against DDos attacks
safeguard web applications
minimize application downtime and latency
standard and advanced
*** integrated with cloudfront

Peneration Testing
practice of testing of one's own app security for vulnerabilities by simulating an attack
limite set of resource where it can be perfomed like EC2 , RDS etc

*** if account is comprimised follow these steps
AWS root account password
IAM users credentials
delete APi access keys
delete any resouces you didnt create
repsond to all notifications

Identity providers and Federation
instead of creating users in IAM they will come from AD/LDAP(SAML) of an organization.
Social providers like Gmail, facebook etc used for mobile apps uses (OIDC) AWS cognito
to use an IDP, create an IAM identitiy provider to estabilish a trust relationship b/w AWS account and IDP.

AWS Single sign on (SSO)
gives access to multiple AWS accounts
takes input from AD, Azure AD etc anf gives access to multiple aws accounts
a company has their own AD,and if they need to access multiple aws accoint use AWS SSO

AWS Directory service
AWS managed AD
all you do is estabilish a trust relationship b/w on prem AD & aws managed AD
with this auth you can access ec2 instances, use AWS management console etc
fully managed AWS service
best choice if you have more than 5000 users or setup trust relationship
works with sharepoint, sql server, .net apps
connect with VPN or directconnect
can be used as standalone AD

Simple AD -> 
least expensive option
less than 500 users and dont need advanced AD features
does not support trust relationship
standalone AD
similar to AWS managed AD but cheaper option

AD connector
must have existing AD
redirects requests to on premise AD
existing AD users can access AWS assets via IAM roles
supports MFA
best choice if u want to use existing AD with AWS.
