Traditional server in Datacenter = CPU + RAM + Disk + network card interface + os
if you need to upgrade you buy more hardware and add it to the datacenter
EC2 instance = Amazon machine image (EBS snapshot + os) + Virtual Hardware(CPU + RAM + Disk + nic) 
you launch more instances in virtual cloud or resize existing ec2 instance with more hardware

Amazon elastic cloud compute (Ec2) is a webservice in AWS compute suite of products that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in cloud
you can increase or decrease capacity within minutes and commission 1 to 1000 instances simultaneously
you have complete control include root access and can start & stop instances without losing data
you can choose multiple instance types, os, and software packages and instances with varying cpu, memory & storage

AMIs
provides information required to launch an instance
includes the folowing:
   one or more Elastic blockstore(EBS) snapshots or instance stored backend AMI's a template for root volume of instance(an      os,an application server and applications).
   launch permissions to control which aws accounts can use AMI to launch instances
   a block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attacg to instance when its launched

three categories:
  community AMIs - free to use, generally select the os you want
  AWS marketplace amis - pay to use , if you have sone additional third party licensed software
  My AMIs - AMIs you create yourself

search for AWS instance types

Hierarchy
select region -> VPC -> Availabilty Zone -> public/private subnet -> EC2 instance 
you can connect to that EC2 instance from your local machine through internet

User data
is supplied by the user at instance launch in form of script
user data is limited to 16kb
user data & metadata are not encrypted
you can create webserver & addd html file to httpd server
running commands when instance launches

Metadata
metadata is about your instance that you can use to configure or manage running instance
querying information about ec2 instance

ECS
provides a high scalable , high performance container management that supports Docker containers
ECS launch type determines the type of infrastructure on which your tasks and services are hosted
2 launch types are
  Amazon EC2
   you explicitly provision EC2 instances
   responsible for upgrading , patching, care of Ec2 pool
   handle cluster optimization
   more control over infrastructure
  Amazon Fargate
  aws manages all of the above
  
AWS Lambda
serverless computing technology that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers
executes code only when needed and scales automatically
pay only for compute time(pay nothing when code is not running)
Benefits:
 billed on seconds
 integrates with all other aws services
Usecases:
 data processing
 real time file processing
 real time stream processing
 build serverless backends for web, mobile, IOT & 3rd party api requests
 serverless means server is always running somehwere & executing the code but you dont need to know about it or manage it or     pay for it
 
AWS lightsail
great for users who do not have deep AWS technical expertise as it makes very easy to provision servers
provides developers compute, storage & networking capacity to easily deploy webistes, web apps and databases
includes a VM, ssd based storage, data transfer, dns management and static ip
it has preconfigured virtual servers that include everything to deploy & application or create a database
can create instances and datavases and configure static ip, dns zone, load balancers, storage and snaphsots
similar to EC2
