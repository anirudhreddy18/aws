Traditional server in Datacenter = CPU + RAM + Disk + network card interface + os
if you need to upgrade you buy more hardware and add it to the datacenter
EC2 instance = Amazon machine image (EBS snapshot + os) + Virtual Hardware(CPU + RAM + Disk + nic) 
you launch more instances in virtual cloud or resize existing ec2 instance with more hardware

Amazon elastic cloud compute (Ec2) is a webservice in AWS compute suite of products that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in cloud
you can increase or decrease capacity within minutes and commission 1 to 1000 instances simultaneously
you have complete control include root access and can start & stop instances without losing data
you can choose multiple instance types, os, and software packages and instances with varying cpu, memory & storage

AMIs
provides information required to launch an instance
includes the folowing:
   one or more Elastic blockstore(EBS) snapshots or instance stored backend AMI's a template for root volume of instance(an      os,an application server and applications).
   launch permissions to control which aws accounts can use AMI to launch instances
   a block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attacg to instance when its launched

three categories:
  community AMIs - free to use, generally select the os you want
  AWS marketplace amis - pay to use , if you have sone additional third party licensed software
  My AMIs - AMIs you create yourself

search for AWS instance types

Hierarchy
select region -> VPC -> Availabilty Zone -> public/private subnet -> EC2 instance 
you can connect to that EC2 instance from your local machine through internet
