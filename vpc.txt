Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)
logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud dedicated to an account within a region
similar to having a Data center inside AWS
can create multiple vpcs in a region
isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud
provides complete control over virtual networking env including selection of IP, subnets and config of route tables and gateways
full control who access inside your vpc
default 5 vpcs in a region
a default vpc is created in each region with a subnet in each AZ.
subnets are created within AZ's
can launch ec2 instances with in subnet in to your vpc
AZ can more than 1 subnets public or private subnet

public subnet -> can be accessed through a public ip like from ssh
Router -> a ec2 instance wants to connect to other ec2 instance they are stored in a route table with close ip address
Internet Gateway -> gateway to internet itself attached to a vpc but kind of sits at edge of region. amazon vpc side of a connection to the public internet.
VPC -> has a CIDR like 172.31.0.0/16 a block of address
subnet -> block of address within the vpc 
peering connection -> direct connection b/w to vpc's
VPC endpoints -> private connection to public AWS services

Security Groups and network ACL's
security groups apply at instance level they control traffic going in & out of the ec2 instance
network access control list applies to subnet level(so if instances are talikg within subnet they dont need acl but if one instance in public subnet wants to talk to other instance in private subnet they need acl)
security groups arew applied to instances in any subnet
security group is stateful acl is stateless
sg supports allow rules acl support allow & deny rules

public IP address:
lost when instance is stopped
used in public subnets
no charge
associated with private ip address of instance

private IP address:
retained when instance is stopped
used in public and private subnets

Elastic IP address:
static ip address
charged if not used
associated with a private ip instance
can be moved b/w instances and elastic network adapters

NAT Gateway(network address translator)
if a ec2 isntance in private subnet wants to connect to internet -> you create a nat gateway with a elastic ip that access internet gateway in a public subnet
then update private subnet route table with nat gateway ip
otherway is a nat instance which is actually a ec2 instance where you have to maintain it yourself

connecting securely to a VPC
AWS managed pin -> customer gateway on DC -> vpn connection -> vpn gateway on VPC (public internet, fast to setup)
Aws direct connect
an alternative to using the internet to connect a cusotmers on premise sites to AWS
can be used as hybrid cloud
data is transmitted through a private network connection between aws and customer datacenter
beenfits:
  reduce cost for laerge volumes of traffic
  increase reliability
  increase bandwidth
  decrease latency
