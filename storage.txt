S3 -> object storage , get, pust, post interact using http methods, managed as individual objects no hierarchy
* object includes data itself, metadata and a global unique identifier
* data is unstructured, unlimited scalability and retention on massive amounts of unstructured data

EBS
data is stored in blocks and volumes
mount amazon ec2 instance to a external harddrive/ssd
you can use bloc storage devices as boot volumes
similar to mounting data to a harddrive/ssd for containers

EFS(elastic file system)
manage data in a file hierarchy
a file system us mounted via network to a client computer where it becomes accessible for reading and writing data
protocols inlcude NFS

Simple object storage
connect client -> public internet -> amazon s3
        ec2 instance -> public internet -> amazon s3
        ec2 instance -> s3 gateway endpoint -> s3
can store any file in s3
high durability never lose the data
usecases:
   backup and storage
   application hosting -> maange web applications
   media hosting -> video, photo,music uploads and downloads
   software delivery -> host software apps others can download
   static website
* Files are stored in buckets
* buckets are root folders
* anywhere from 0 to 5TB
** s3 is a universal namepsace so bucket names must be unique globally
** create buckets in a region close to you
Object:
 key (name of object)
 value(data made up of seq if bytes)
 verId(used for versioning)
 metadata(data about data that is stored)
Pricing:
  storage
  requests
  storage management pricing
  data transfer pricing
  transfer acceleration

check amazon s3 storage classes
transfer acceleration -> speed up data uploads using cloudfront in reverse
requestor pays -> requester pay for requests and data transfer where as you pay for storage
tags
events -> trigger notifcations ton sns, sqs or lamda for certain events
static website hosting
bit torrent
*** cross region replication is possibel and also same region replication
